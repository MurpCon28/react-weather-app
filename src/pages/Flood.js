            Floods are among the most frequent and costly natural disasters. Flooding often occurs following a hurricane,
            thawing snow, or several days of sustained rain. Flash floods occur suddenly, due to rapidly rising water
            along a stream or low-lying area. Learn what to do to keep your loved ones safe!
