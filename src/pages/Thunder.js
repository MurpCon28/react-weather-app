            A thunderstorm is considered severe if it produces hail at least 1 inch in diameter or has wind
            gusts of at least 58 miles per hour. Every thunderstorm produces lightning, which kills more people
            each year than tornadoes or hurricanes. Heavy rain from thunderstorms can cause flash flooding,
            and high winds can damage homes and blow down trees and utility poles, causing widespread power outages.
